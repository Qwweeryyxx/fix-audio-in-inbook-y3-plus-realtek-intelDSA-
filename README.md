when buying a new infinix inbook y3 plus laptop I noticed that in my beloved Fedora, as in other and other distributions, there is a complete lack of sound. I've tried everything, but I've just found a way to fix it and I'm sharing it with you.

1. git clone https://github.com/Qwweeryyxx/fix-audio-in-inbook-y3-plus-realtek-intelDSA-
